                <p class='prose-first-paragraph'>This is an interactive Design 
                Structure Matrix (DSM) where a dot indicates that the employee 
                along the left side reports to the employee along the top. The 
                DSM is a visibility matrix, which means that in addition to showing 
                direct reports, we also show indirect reports. Hence, an employee 
                is shown as reporting to his or her direct manager, as well as to 
                his or her manager's manager and so on. We achieve this through 
                matrix multiplication.</p>
                <p>The term for the number of managers that an employee reports to, 
                directly or indirectly, is <i>fan-out</i> and the term for the number 
                of staff that report to a particular manager is <i>fan-in</i>. The 
                manager with the largest team is hence the manager with the largest 
                fan-in, and taking an average of the fan-out for all staff gives us 
                a sense of the average distance to the CEO.</p>
                <p>Depending on how the matrix is sorted, different clusters of dots 
                indicate different things. When we sort the matrix by timezone, then 
                location then manager&mdash;the current case&mdash;vertical lines show 
                staff who are either physically close to each other or in the same 
                timezone. The more spread out a vertical line is, the more spread out 
                a manager's team members are.</p>
                <p><b>You can mouse-over the matrix to reveal details about its various 
                parts or view details about a particular manager's team by clicking 
                anywhere on the matrix or by choosing a manager from the dropdown.</b></p>

                <p>Of the <span class='number-of-teams'></span> teams at INITECH, 23 
                teams are entirely in the same timezone or within two hours of the same 
                timezone; 12 teams have a maximum time difference of 18 to 20 hours.</p>
